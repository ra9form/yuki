Minimal server platform for gRPC and REST+Swagger APIs in Go

Using clay you can automatically spin up HTTP handlers for your gRPC server with
complete Swagger defs with a few lines of code.

This project provides the HTTP+Swagger handler generator and optional server that you
can use to serve your handlers via any protocol.
